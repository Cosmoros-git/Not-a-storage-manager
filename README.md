This SE mod is centred around storage management, items filtering, and production automation in a way that scripts can't achieve.  
And I can already see your question: Why did I name it “Not a storage manager”? I bet it totally made you look at it. 

It’s still WIP, but it’s already able to get the data I need to work with, and I have just decided to publish it to Git Hub. 

You can use my scripts where you need them or as a reference for getting something out of the game.  The “GetCrafterAndCraftees” is practically a standalone script that provides you with a convenient XML file in %appdata% SE storage folder with all ores, items, components, also where they are made, how long it takes to make it, etc. Quite convenient for me.
