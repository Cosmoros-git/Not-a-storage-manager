Welcome to my trash vacuum mod. 

All it does is adds a modified Conveyor Sorter that dynamically, depending on the number of items you wish to have, sucks out all the rest.
That’s it. You are free to use it with any inventory management scripts just make sure that my filter goes into something that will eliminate those items. 

Now le guide. In custom data of the magnificent filter, you have just to filter out how many items you want in your system.
You might as well run multiple filters (just don’t create loops) and have the items go into different storages for recycling. 

But beware. You must add it to the custom data, tag [TRASH]; what else is written there doesn't matter. It will just make me sure not to count those inventories in trash collection, leaving you to not panic save all your items because they run off into the incinerator ;D.


This is downgrade of my storage manager mod. Maybe with time it will be a storage manager mod. Who knows. Pray that there is no some edge case and my OnDispose works correctly.
